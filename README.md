# What I learned and created.

Learned more about react, useState, react-router.
Tried to create full project with get started page where you can try work with expense tracker app, landing page, about us page and support page.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
